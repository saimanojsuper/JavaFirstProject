Class Diagram:

In the diagram fields are not defined properly as public,private,potected or package using the symbols.

Two main classes are defined. Customer class with name,locations as fields and sendOrder(),receiveOrder() methods. Order class is the superclass of the SpecialOrder and NormalOrder classes defined with date,number as fields and confirm(),close() as methods.

The subclass SpecialOrder has an addition method dispatch()  and NormalOrder subclass has two additional methods dispatch(),receive() other than the inherited methods from the Order class.

The Diagram represents a order management system where customer objects gives an order and the order objects delivers the order based on whether order belongs to SpecialOrder or NormalOrder.
